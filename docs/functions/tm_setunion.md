# `tm_setunion` Function

The `tm_setunion` function takes multiple sets and produces a single set
containing the elements from all of the given sets. In other words, it
computes the [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_\(set_theory\)) of
the sets.

```hcl
tm_setunion(sets...)
```

## Examples

```
tm_setunion(["a", "b"], ["b", "c"], ["d"])
[
  "d",
  "b",
  "c",
  "a",
]
```

The given arguments are converted to sets, so the result is also a set and
the ordering of the given elements is not preserved.
