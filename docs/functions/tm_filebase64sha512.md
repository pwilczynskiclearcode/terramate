# `tm_filebase64sha512` Function

`filebase64sha512` is a variant of [`tm_base64sha512`](./tm_base64sha512.md)
that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string.

This is similar to `base64sha512(file(filename))`, but
because [`tm_file`](./tm_file.md) accepts only UTF-8 text it cannot be used to
create hashes for binary files.
